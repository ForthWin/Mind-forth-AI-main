* Before you take the trouble to download and unzip the specific Win32Forth 
W32FOR42_671.zip version into which you must "fload" and run the free AI 
source code listed below, if you use the Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) 
Web browser you may click on the JavaScript Mind.html tutorial AI Mind
http://mind.sourceforge.net/Mind.html 
to see in advance how the Mind.Forth AI program operates and thinks. 

Both Mind.Forth and the JavaScript AI Mind operate on the neuroscientific 
principle of spreading activation -- the idea that ideas arise in the brain-mind 
as spikes of excitation flit from concept to concept across associative tags 
that connect momentary sensory memories with slowly emerging concepts.
